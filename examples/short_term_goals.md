# Short-Term Goals
As a large vendor of fruits we want to improve in the following areas before next quarter:
- Expand global reach
- Expand inventory in capital cities
- Look into upcoming fruits
- Advertise fruits to a younger audience

## Additional longer-term goals
We want to split our brand in two:
- **Fruits for taste**: Eating fruit because it is delicious
- **Fruits for health**: Eating fruit because they are good for you

_Additionally we would like to create a strong (social) media presence for these brands._
